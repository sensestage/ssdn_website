This is the code for the webpage for the documentation of the Sense/Stage MiniBee.

The site can currently be found at: [https://www.sensestage.eu/documentation](https://www.sensestage.eu/documentation); this is a temporary location until the site has the most necessary content.

The site uses [LuaPress](https://github.com/Fizzadar/Luapress) to be build. Please mind [this issue](https://github.com/Fizzadar/Luapress/issues/17), when installing LuaPress.

I'm happy to get suggestions, fixes, updates, and so on for the website!
